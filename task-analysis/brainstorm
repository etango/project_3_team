It's important to have meaningful placeholder text to illustrate exactly what has
to be input into them. Sometimes it's the full email, sometimes it's just the
username. Is the "Forgot Password" useful? If they need their password to
access their email, then how can they configure something to send to an alternate
email? Or maybe a verification sent to phone?

At login, there should be something parses the users information through a
database so that it can provide the most prevalent information such as
undergraduate, graduate, co-terminal etc.

    My Degree Works
    My Email

Should provide the most important links. Grades, Schedules and Course Links
should provide the relevant courses and schedules for the type of student,
so if a student is U1-U3, they shouldn't be receiving graduate information unless
requested or the student specifically looks for it.

Most important thing is to decrease the number of clicks to get to wherever the
student is trying to reach. In this case, it's important to allow easy and
intuitive access to the student transcripts. Currently, the banner self service
is a VERY annoying process of many clicks that no user would realize to even go
but now, we're looking to redesign so that it's not only intuitive but easy to
access, both through a desktop and mobile first application.
Should allow the students to see semester/midterm/final grades
  ---Blackboard provides assignment grades
With the current system, it requires many clicks through a directory that is
not intuitive in letting the students know what to do. In addition, the current
transcript display is a variety of frames, so that if the student wants to print
or save them as a PDF, it gets the most outer frame which is the banner and
header which provides nothing of relevance.
